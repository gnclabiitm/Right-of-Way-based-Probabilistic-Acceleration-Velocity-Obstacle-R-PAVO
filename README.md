"Right-of-Way-Based Higher-Order Velocity Obstacle Algorithm For Collision Avoidance In Multi-Agent Environments."
This work addresses the problem of safe oscillation-free motion planning in multi-agent obstacle-cluttered environments, which becomes more challenging when the environment is dynamic and uncertainties present in the sensor measurements and the obstacles’ motion.
Experiments and simulations encompassing both physical mobile robots and virtual agents in Gazebo-simulated environments using the ROS Framework can be performed using the packages provided here.
The TurtleBot3 Burger, developed by Robotis,are used to test motion planning algorithms that include various tasks such as mapping, navigation, and object detection. The robots are equipped with a 360° Laser Distance Sensor with a sensing range Rs = 0.16 to 8 m.
